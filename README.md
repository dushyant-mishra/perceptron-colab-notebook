# perceptron-colab-notebook
This Jupyter notebook contains an implementation of a perceptron. Its a demonstration why some logic gates such as AND, OR etc. are easily classified while others such as XOR cannot be solved by a single binary classifier. For solving more complicated gates multi layer perceptrons or complicated combinations of logic gates are required.
